# i-UM Disrupt Hackathon Experience

Hello there! a couple days back I decided to make use of my Eid holidays with something productive. Within the spur of the moment, I decided to join a hackathon event, to be specific the i-UM Disrupt organized by University of Malaya. Prior to this, I have never join any hackathon, so I am a bit behind on what the event would be like. But all in all, the event was organized very well with clear guidelines, and a lot of interesting workshops. I am also super satisfied and surprise that we actually won 5th place! Around 35 teams, with 5 members each joined the event, 6 teams going to finals, and 5 winners. All in all an absolute pleasant learning experience for me personally.

I attended the event registering as an individual, so it is a bit more challenging to get to know new people and start working together as a team. Fortunately, my team members is awesome and we hit the ball right off the bat. With workshops attended and project topics announced, we decided to get to work. There’s 3 track (topics) that teams can choose, Future of Mobility, Solving Mobility Problems Using AI Technology and Normalization of Retail Market under Endemic State; we took the last track. This track main goal is to develop a solution to the everchanging market since the pandemic. So a good point of view to see this track is taking into account of the market status quo, consumer trends, and scientific journals on the topic. 

## What we came up with

We decided to narrow our focus on a smaller market, which is the retail market (fashion, clothing). With a narrower scope, we can then focus on researching relevant information on the topic. Our research concluded a few things, to no surprise digital shopping has become the norm with very high penetration on the market. Another important thing, there is a need for physical integration with digital shopping experience; this can take the form of Pickup centers. 

So, considering the findings of our research, we decided to make a marketplace for the retail fashion market. We know this idea is very saturated at this point, with all kinds of marketplace popping out and dies out of popularity within a very small window. So for the hackathon, we decided to implement new features that eases the digital shopping experience, and also integrating physical with digital shopping.

one of the key feature we decided to implement is 3D modelling try on. With the advent of VR, and AR technologies in the rise, traditional 3D modelling is rarely used. 3D models is a time proven tech, with application across all kinds of fields, and since it is well established, we can make accurate models unique to each customer with fairly accurate measurements. 

Let’s talk about that 3D tech, each customer will go through a one time process which they will insert body measurements into the system. After this, a cloud computer will then generate a personalized model with the measurements, with API used between different platforms to share this data with one another. Now, the user can freely browse clothing catalogs, and can test out different cloths on the model. Before buying the clothes, users can check which sizes will fit their body, what color will look good with different combinations, etc. This eases the digital shopping experience, and also solves one of the main concern of buying clothes online, miss buy. 

But accidents happen, maybe a user inserted inaccurate measurements, or they lose weight changing the body proportions. With the clothes they bought arriving in wrong sizes, it is annoying to go through a long process of filing a size exchange, sending the item back, waiting days, to get the correct size clothes. This is why integration between physical and digital shopping is important. BOPIS (buy online, pick up in store) points will also be a stable of our solution; with pickup centers facilitating change, warranty claims, and picking up items.

### What went well

With the event taking place for about a week, it involves teams developing a solution, attending workshops, and finally a pitching session. We took around 2 days researching the topic, coming up with ideas, and preparing for pitching session. But personally I think the part I really shined in this event is the pitching session. **To my surprise I was actually pretty decent in pitching ideas to people, I do believe that charisma and confidence wins over ideas in this kind of event.** Our team solution does not involve any technical part, with prototype being a wireframe, with no actual implementation on the technical part of 3D models, physical integration, etc. But we were able to win over hearts with excellent pitching on our end, and addressing concerns from judges, taking us to the finals.

### What can be improved

But talking can only takes you so far, **our team lack the technical implementation of our solution**, with hackathon being a technical event testing your skills in implementing solution, we didn’t really do justice to this. We can really feel that we fall short from the other teams who actually implement their solutions and actually fiddles with tech and code. Personally I believe that we won 5th place only because of our affluency on our solution, being able to answer all concerns and question of the judges.

Therefore, it is crucial to actually research on technical part and codes in developing a solution. In future hackathons, I am going to focus on this by developing prototype in a working form, and not just basic wireframes.
