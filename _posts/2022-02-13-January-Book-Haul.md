# January Book Haul

As it stands, 2022 is the birth of this website. Never before did I ever thought of having my own personal website, let alone blog in it. Alas, after reading an amazing book called Show Your Work! by Austin Kleon, buying a domain and starting a website was my top priority. I spent my pocket money (which isn‚Äôt a lot for starters) and bought this exciting domain *[nabilalkahar.site](http://nabilalkahar.site)* for 15,000 rupiah, what a deal. A history mark for my first wise investment.

I have a couple ideas on what to write, and one of them is book hauls, my take of the said books after reading them. Last January I have read 4 books, from novel, non-fiction, to self-help books. And one of which is the exact reason why I started this website, and as the next node in the creative community, I should also spread the inspirations that changed the way I think.

## Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind

### Yuval Noah Harari

This book was a first non-fiction book I have ever read, and in 1 word, it was *amazing.* I‚Äôve always been interested in history, often finding myself browsing Wikipedia, and traversing from one hyperlink to another. And this book was a ride through the history of humans, from mindless apes, war addicts, and now as Yuval says, ‚ÄúThe animals that became god‚Äù.

If you think about it, it really is unfathomable how humans become the rulers of earth, from being eaten by lions.  Yuval explains this quite admirably, referencing enormous amount of sources, whilst also adding his own thoughts and opinions. 

Summarizing this book is difficult, not only that it is already a form of summarization of our history itself, it also takes the readers into every major step that the humankind took. But if there‚Äôs one thing I can take from this book, the one de facto reason why we humans, evolve into what we are today. The Homo Sapiens, the wise apes, difference is in our ability to believe, imagine, and concord information that doesn‚Äôt exist in our real lives. 

Only those of homo sapiens, from all animal kingdom have the stock market, religions, and believing in a common cause between others. This very ability enables us to work together, tied by a fictional bond inside each of ourselves; It could be religion, the same ancestor beliefs, the trust in companies, the trust in nations, etc. 

Something that we thought and take from granted and often than not, not even aware of such things because of how embedded this concepts have been in our lives. It takes the viewer into a third part perspective, on our lives, human kind, and the Sapiens.

The alchemist is a quite enjoyable, but not very much my cup of tea. It reads like a book from the olden times, a classic. It tells the story of a young man, in pursuit of his *‚Äúpersonal legends‚Äù* Words that is the center of the book. Santiago, a shepherd grazing the lands of Andalusia, travelling from grasslands to grasslands. And on a faithful day, he met a king, a wise king that holds the knowledge of the worlds. 

Long story short, this sparks up the intent of travels from Santiago, who has been dreaming of the pyramids of Giza holding his treasure. He goes through meadows ,oceans, deserts, buzzling markets, tribal wars. And through it all, challenges come and go, and from each he learns something new, shaping the man he becomes of now. 

Although it‚Äôs just a fictional novel, I also learnt something from this interesting book. *‚Äúpersonal legends‚Äù* as Paulo said, or which we can refer to as our *‚Äúdreams and goals‚Äù,* is often forgotten by us as we grow and live our lives. A strong emphasis on chasing your dreams, and the world will conspire to help you is the main passage of the book; a beautiful reminder.

Steal like an artist is the first of the trilogy by Austin, to summarize, the art of stealing ideas; a key list of things that everyone should know, this book discusses about the best ways to be inspired and take inspirations for your works.

Inside it Austin delves down deep into all kinds of people, artists, musicians, writers, and shines a light on how those people get their ideas. He also emphasizes the importance of crediting those that you took inspiration from. 

This book has been a valuable piece to me, as I have been working on personal projects, it helps to be able to be inspired, take ideas from different sources, and developing something entirely new from it.

Show Your Work! is the second book from the trilogy, as you have learned how to steal ideas from the first book, and how to develop it into your own work. It is time to Show Your Work! to the world (see what I did there üòâ), because without showing your handwork to the masses, what‚Äôs the point?

Sharing your projects, achievements, thoughts, has never been easier; with the birth of internet, all barriers of sharing and showcasing your work vanishes. Back then, an aspiring scientist, has to go to parties, networking with fellow scientist, stakeholders, venture capitalist, professors. A time consuming, and money heavy activity, not to mention the need of knowing certain folks to be invited in the first place!

This book wakes you up to the opportunity you are missing out on. Your own little project showcase place, in the corners of the internet, and the importance of showing your work to the masses. Through sharing, we get to receive critiques, suggestions, and also new friends and folks that is also interested in the topic

I have always been timid, anxious of my work that is subpar relative to those others. But a lesson can be learned from the book, no one starts a master, and critiques are the building blocks of the road to mastery. Sharing your work opens up a path of new ideas, friends, and opportunities ahead; and this website is my take on sharing my work.
